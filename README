To use the fastestmirror patch:

1) download yum-plugin-timemirrorbandwidth/timemirrorbandwidth.py
2) If you are on a current version of Fedora or on EL6+, edit the required api version to 2.6
3) place it in /usr/lib/yum-plugins/
4) create /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/timemirrorbandwidth.conf
5) edit the conf file above to have:
[main]
enabled=1

6) It's now installed. To use, execute:
yum time-mirrors --disableplugin=fastestmirror

This will start scoring the available mirrors and add the fastest three for each repo into fastestmirror.conf's include_only list. It will not run every time you use yum because of extreme slowdown.

7) Enjoy!
